# Whatsapp data grapher 
The graphs generated by this script display whatsapp group data (messages sent by users with over 2000 messages and number of messages per day)

# Installation
In order to use this script you have 2 options: 
Optional 1: Install `matplotlib` directory with 
```
pip install matplotlib 
```
Optional 2: Use the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`:
2.1 (Skip if you have pipenv) Install pipenv with
```
pip install pipenv
```
2.2 execute (In the Pipfile directory)
```
python -m pipenv install
```
2.3 execute the pipenv context
```
pipenv shell
```
(if the pipfile doesnt contain matplotlib make sure to install with `pip install matplotlib`)

# Usage
1. Generate a whatsapp group's export into a txt file (without media), remove all lines that dont match the partial regex `^\[.*\]`
2. Rename the export file to `chat_export.txt` (or modify the script to customize your own file name) and insert it into the script directory
3. Run `whatsapp_stats_redacted.py`
3.5 Remove entries in the table that don't look valid. 
4. Run `analyze_data_redacted.py`(if you want a different number of message limits edit the code's constant (FILTER_THRESHOLD) in the filter from 3000 to whatever you want - line 56)
